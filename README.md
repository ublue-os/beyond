What a GNOME OS could look like in the future—today 

Beyond is an opinionated look at what an ideal GNOME-based OS would look like, from the perspective of [Cassidy James Blaede](https://cassidyjames.com). Initial goals:

- **GNOME core apps** from Flathub, including upcoming hopeful inclusions e.g. Web, Console, Loupe, etc.
- **Flathub included as a user remote** so each user can install their own apps without interfering with other users
- **Dock** integrated as well as it can be into Shell since it’s the number one complaint I hear about GNOME from new users in the wild
- **GNOME design experiments** like experimental Activities button behavior, font changes, and more to come
